############# Take Aways from this code ################

1. COUNT(DISTINCT column_name) should be the way it is supposed to be coded
2. In GROUP BY clause, WHERE can be used and HAVING need not be used always
3. GROUP BY c.company_code, c.founder -- this statement required founder to be included along with company code as it is the part of the select statement.
